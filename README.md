# Valentine's Day Proposal Interactive

Welcome to the **Valentine's Day Proposal Interactive** page, a playful and engaging way to ask the most significant question on a very special day. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fun interaction that culminates in a romantic proposal.

## Project Description

This interactive webpage is designed to bring a smile and hopefully a "Yes!" by making the proposal experience fun and memorable. The page features a button that, when hovered, eludes the cursor, making it difficult to click 'No', thereby adding a playful challenge. Clicking 'Yes' reveals a heartwarming surprise.

## Features

- **Dynamic Button Movement**: The 'No' button moves randomly within the page when the user attempts to hover over it, adding a humorous challenge to the experience.
- **Interactive Elements**: The page includes interactive buttons that react to user input, enhancing engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS for a pleasant visual and interactive experience across various devices and screen sizes.
